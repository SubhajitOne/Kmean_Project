# Kmeans_Project
Here Kmeans clustering is used to cluster Universities between two groups i) Public ii)Private
Although in real world data we do not have a label col, but here we have col 'Private' as the label column.
This is done primarily to see how well the model predicts the clusters using classification report and confusion matrix.
Here in this dataset we have 18 variables.
Explainatory Data Analysis was done to find any correlation among the features present.
Elimination of any unusual data was done.
Kmeans clustering model was prepared and have droped the label column 'Private' while doing so.
Now evaluation was done using the label column with the help of Confusion Matrix and Classification Report.
